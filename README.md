## Plazi BRAHMS8 taxonomy integrator

Initially just a playground for calling data from the Plazi API for integration into BRAHMS8. Will form the basis for something more concrete once things are better understood.

### Installation and usage

You will need [`git`](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [`Python`](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed. 

Clone this repo to your local machine, open the folder, click in the address bar of the folder, type cmd and enter to open a command window. 

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install requirements.

Back in the folder, you can open script.py in a text editor like Notepad (not MS Word!) and edit the article_doi variable for the article you want (add just the DOI, not the whole DOI URL). Save your changes.

In the command line run `python script.py`. It will give some output, and that's as far as we are thus far. 

Check back here to see if there are updates (you'll see dates next to the file names), and/or run `git pull` on the command line to get the latest updates, and then `python script.py` again to see what the code is doing. 

I'll be updating the script incrementally as we go along and work towards what we need.
